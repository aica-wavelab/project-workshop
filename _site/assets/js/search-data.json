Marcelle is built around components embedding computation and interaction that can be composed to form reactive machine learning pipelines and custom user interfaces. This architecture enables rapid prototyping and extension. Marcelle can be used to build interfaces to Python scripts, and it provides flexible data stores to facilitate collaboration between machine learning experts, designers and end users.

The Wekinator is free, open source software that allows anyone to use machine learning to build new musical instruments, gestural game controllers, computer vision or computer listening systems, and more. The Wekinator allows users to build new interactive systems by demonstrating human actions and computer responses, instead of writing programming code. Fiebrink, R., &amp; Cook, P. R.
