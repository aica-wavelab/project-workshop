#  **Enroll now! ðŸ’¥**

<!--
Please follow these steps to enroll in the class.


## 1. Express your interest

## Sign up on the administrative platform of your university 
 -->

Register directly via mail to Mariya Dzhimova ([mariya [dot] dzhimova [at] hm [dot] edu](mailto:mariya.dzhimova@hm.edu)).

To validate the class and get the credits / grade, HM students must register for the exam in *PRIMUSS*.


<!-- 
## 3. Sign up to the moodle platform

The moodle platform is open to both HM and HMTM students. It is **not** an administrative platform, but tool to exchange between students and teachers.
It is meant to gather all institutional emails, submit and collect assigments, and publish grades.
