## Group A : Human-machine co-improvisation

Great job for the PoC video! Please move on with the improvements you described.

## Group B : Collaborative visual story-telling

If the image generation from a story works in python, it has yet to be an interactive application that people can easily use. Please refer to [our last office hour feedback](/docs/feedback/office_hours_summary) for future improvements. Remember to work on the utility and application scope of your system; last time we talked, it still needed to be clarified. Good luck!


## Group C : Music generation from movements and dance

The video is not fully clear, but it seems to work and you clearly made progress! Your personal reflections on the results would be appreciated for the next video/bloc. Is the interaction you are designing engaging for users? Improvements evoked during [our last office hour](/docs/feedback/office_hours_summary) are still relevant. The real milestone would be to try a life-size installation! Good luck!

## Group D : Virtual archives of clothing artefacts

The physics of your clothing item is not bad at all! However, the video is a bit long, and only two body points were mapped. Hence, it was unclear if the system was really working. Please map the entire skeleton to your clothing model so we can reflect better on possible improvements: is the bottleneck the skeleton extraction, the clothing model, or something else? Good luck!

## Group E : AI-augmented audio guide

Great job for implementing a user interface. Improvements can now be made in the generation speed and interface design. Do not hesitate to reach out to us for help on these topics. Good luck!
