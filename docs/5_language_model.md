# Language model for domain-specific application
{: .no_toc}


AI entered the mainstream in 2022 thanks to dramatic progresses in natural language processing, in particular text generation. Most of you now use ML-powered text generation tools, such as ChatGPT, to write emails, reports, and maybe your next novel?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are generalists but open opportunities for domain-specific applications, including in the creative and cultural industries.

As you may know, training a powerful text generation model is not an easy task, it requires tremendous amounts of data and computing power. This technology sparked many ethical and economic concerns, especially in the creative and cultural industries where intellectual property is of paramount importance. The human labor required to produce quality data is rarely acknowledged or compensated.

Then, understanding this technology is a prerequisite to design meaningful tools for practitioners. This chapter will teach you basics about language models, and how to use them to create domain-specific applications that binds the generalist knowledge of LLMs with the specialist knowledge of your own corpus of text.
