## What is AICA? 

The Digitization College "Artificial Intelligence in Culture and Arts" (AICA) aims to equip students at the [University of Music and Performing Arts Munich](https://hmtm.de/) (HMTM) and [Hochschule M√ºnchen University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html) (HM) with necessary skills to impact AI innovations in the creative and cultural industries.

## What is the project workshop ?

The AICA Project Workshop will be hosted at the Wavelab, in the Winter Semester 2024/2025 **starting early November 2024**.
This course will teach you how to build and apply AI and machine learning for the cultural and artistic domains.

You will develop **your own project** at the interface of AI in art and culture, spanning from an intelligent or interactive tool, an artistic performance, or anything in between that applies to the creative and cultural industries.

You will form **a team with students from HM and HMTM** with complementary expertise: computer science, data science, design, music, theater, or cultural management. 

You will be accompanied **on site** by technology and culture experts, and coached with [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) practices.

## Evaluation and ECTS

You will earn **6 ECTS** for the validation of the course.

The evaluation will be based on 100 points, distributed as follows:
- 30 points for the careful completion of the assignements between blocks;
- 20 points for the final presentation, on the 30th of January 2025: oral presence, slides quality, and clarity of the outcomes and dissemination;
- 20 points for significance of the project outcomes and their potential impact on the cultural and artistic domains;
- 20 points for the relevance and significiance of the project's dissemination;
- 10 points for dedication and attitude: attendance, proactivity, team spirit, and respect. Additional penalties may be applied in case of deliberate misconduct that would harm the team or the course.

The 100 points will then be converted to the German grading system according to the table below:

| Points     | German system | Description                |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| 90 - 100   | 1.0           | Very good (Sehr gut)        |

We encourage students to extend and capitalize on their projects to derive a bachelor or master thesis.
