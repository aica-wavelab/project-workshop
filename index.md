## What is the project workshop ?

The AICA Project Workshop will be hosted at the Wavelab, in the Winter Semester 2024/2025 **starting early November 2024**.
This course will teach you how to build and apply AI and machine learning for the cultural and artistic domains.



You will develop **your own project** at the interface of AI in art and culture, spanning from an intelligent or interactive tool, an artistic performance, or anything in between that applies to the creative and cultural industries.

You will form **a team with students from HM and HMTM** with complementary expertise: computer science, data science, design, music, theater, or cultural management. 

You will be accompanied **on site** by technology and culture experts, and coached with [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) practices.
